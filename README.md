# ℹ️ About the Project

This is an IELTS Training Website built using React and Vite. It provides a frontend-only experience without a real backend. 

The project includes dummy login and signup functionality that simulates backend behavior — users can log in and interact with the app without any actual email or password verification. Similarly, the app imitates receiving and displaying data as if it were coming from a server.

All features are fully functional on the frontend, demonstrating UI design, animations, responsive layouts, and interactivity.
